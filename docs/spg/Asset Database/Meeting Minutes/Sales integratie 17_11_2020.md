# **ðŸŽ¯\*\*** Agenda\*\*

-   as is situation
-   overlap and requirements for Vault & Consilio

# **ðŸ—’ Notes**

-   as is
    -   data can be extracted from thermal datasheet and imported into Consilio
    -   data can be pulled in Inventor to quickly create a roughly accurate model
    -   today we only have 1 sales project in consilio that is linked to 1 project in Vault
        -   1 project = a loooot of files
        -   project gets overwritten for each sales track
        -   changes are stored in export files
-   to be
    -   do we need separate environments for sales vs "normal" projects?
        -   nope
        -   Vault can set a "sales" flag
            -   what about user access?
                -   not that easy to set up different user access within the same Vault
                -   will mostly be accessed by designers anyway, no distinction needed
        -   Consilio can use project status and user roles to filter out projects
    -   changes to Vault
        -   no big changes needed, can be implemented with existing and pending functionality
    -   changes to Consilio
        -   add sales role, filter out on project status
        -   extend filter on overview
            -   filter out sales status by default
            -   allow multiple statuses to be selected

# **âœ…\*\*** Action items\*\*

-   [ ] LF adds status filter on homepage
-   [ ] LF adds role in Auth0 that can only access projects in sales phase
-   [ ] Arkance runs test to see if new folder structure works
